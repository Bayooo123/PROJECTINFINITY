OFFICIAL LECTURE NOTES & MCQS FOR COMMERCIAL LAW (AGENCY & HIRE PURCHASE)

PART I: AGENCY
Fundamental Legal Purpose: To allow an agent to contract with third parties, creating reciprocal rights and liabilities between the principal and the third party.
Key Latin Maxim: "Qui facit per alium facit per se" (He who acts through another acts himself).
Agent's Role (Fridman's definition): Affects the principal's legal position by making contracts or disposing of property in respect of strangers to the relationship.

Types of Authority:
- Actual Authority: Express or implied consent from the principal.
- Apparent/Ostensible Authority (Agency by Estoppel): Arises when the principal's conduct leads third parties to reasonably believe an agency exists. A representation by the principal is essential. Case: SOBELL INDUSTRIES v. CORY BROSCO (Confirming House liability).
- Agency by Ratification: Principal subsequently accepts an unauthorized act. The principal must be in existence when the act was done (Caligara v Giovanni Sartori).

Creation of Agency:
- Express Agreement: Can be formal (Power of Attorney).
- Implied Agreement: Inferred from conduct.
- Ratification: As above.
- Necessity: In emergencies.

Agent's Duties:
- Duty to Disclose: Must disclose all offers, especially higher ones.
- Fiduciary Duty: Relationship of trust and confidence. Must account for secret profits/commissions (Boston Deep Sea Fishing Co. v Ansell).
- Duty to Keep Proper Records.
- Duty regarding money: Must not mingle principal's funds with their own.

Agent's Rights:
- Right to Remuneration: Except for gratuitous agents.
- Right to Indemnity: For liabilities incurred during the agency.

Agent's Personal Liability: An agent for a named principal generally drops out of the contract. However, they incur personal liability if they sign a bill of exchange in their own name, or if they act for an undisclosed principal in certain situations.

Specific Agent Types:
- Factor: A mercantile agent entrusted with goods for sale with wide discretionary powers.
- Broker: Has no possession of goods and cannot sell in their own name.
- Del Credere Agent: For extra commission, guarantees payment by third parties.
- Confirming House: Confirms orders for overseas buyers, incurring primary liability.

Termination of Agency:
- Unilateral revocation by principal requires express notice to third parties.
- Illegality of the subject matter terminates the agency.
- Insanity of principal automatically terminates the agency (except in irrevocable agencies).

PART II: HIRE PURCHASE
Nature of Hire Purchase: A contract where goods are hired with an option for the hirer to purchase them. Ownership remains with the owner until the final installment is paid.
Common Law: Allowed owner to exercise wide discretion over the hirer (e.g., repossessing goods).
Hire Purchase Act 1965: Introduced regulations and protections.
- Memorandum: Must contain a statement of the hire purchase price and cash price.
- Repossession: If a hirer defaults, the owner has the right to repossess (Animashawun v CFAO).
- Minimum Payment Clause: Sets the hirer's maximum liability if they terminate the agreement.

OFFICIAL LECTURE NOTES FOR CRIMINAL LAW (UNIVERSITY OF LAGOS)

TOPIC: INTRODUCTION TO CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY (Dr. Bamgbose)
- Vicarious Liability: Generally not applicable in criminal law due to the requirement of mens rea, but a statute can impose it. An employer may be liable for an employee's criminal act.
  - Case: Ogbuagu v Police: Newspaper proprietor was acquitted for employee's seditious publication because the servant was not acting as an agent of the proprietor.
  - Contrast: Adjei v R: Chairman & MD of a newspaper was held vicariously liable for editor's seditious publication.
- Corporate Liability: An incorporated entity can be held liable for a criminal offence.
  - Doctrine of Identification (Alter Ego): The law recognizes certain senior officers as the 'brains' and 'hands' of the company. Their acts are the company's acts. (Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattress).
- Strict Liability: The law holds the accused responsible even if the act was not intentional, negligent, or reckless. The statute may expressly exclude mens rea.
  - Often found in public nuisance and criminal libel.
  - Case: R v Larsonneur: A French citizen was deported back to England against her will and then convicted for being an alien to whom leave to land had been refused. The circumstances of her return were immaterial. The offence was one of strict liability.

TOPIC: SEXUAL OFFENCES (Dr. Gbenga Akingbehin)
Rape (S.357 CC):
- Elements: Unlawful carnal knowledge of woman/girl, Without consent.
- Actus Reus: Unlawful carnal knowledge (penetration). Slightest penetration is sufficient (Ogunbayo v. State).
- Mens Rea: Intention to have unlawful carnal knowledge coupled with knowledge of lack of consent.
- Capacity: A boy under 12 is doli incapax (S.30 CC). In Lagos, this is now 10 years.
- Consent: Vitiated by force, threat, intimidation, fear of harm, or impersonation of a husband. Post-penetration withdrawal of consent is possible (Kaitamaki v. R).
- Defences: Mistake of fact (DPP v. Morgan), but this is now viewed with recklessness as to consent.

Indecent Assault (S.360 CC):
- Elements: An assault that is indecent. The five ingredients of assault (S.252 CC) must be present plus indecency.
- Indecency: Act is usually targeted at private parts.
- Husband/Wife: Husband lacks capacity to commit indecent assault on his wife (Alawusa v. Odusote).

Defilement (S.218, S.221 CC):
- Unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under 13 (S.218, life imprisonment) or between 13 and 16 (S.221, misdemeanour).
- Strict Liability: Consent is NOT a defence. Mistake as to age is generally not a defence.
- Special Requirements: Prosecution must begin within 2 months of the offence (Mayaki v. The State). Corroboration is required (though dispensed with for rape).

TOPIC: HOMICIDE (Dr. Akeem Olajide Bello)
- Homicide: Killing of a human being by another. Lawful or unlawful.
- Actus Reus of Murder (S.315 CC): Unlawfully killing another.
- Mens Rea of Murder (S.316 CC): Includes intent to kill or do grievous harm.
- Causation: Act of accused must be a substantial cause of death. Chain of causation can be broken by 'Novus Actus Interveniens' (e.g., grossly negligent medical treatment, R v Jordan). Refusal of medical treatment by victim does not break chain (R v Blaue).
- Manslaughter (S.317 CC): Unlawful killing not amounting to murder. Can be voluntary (e.g. provocation) or involuntary (e.g. gross negligence).
- Provocation (S.318 CC): Reduces murder to manslaughter. Requires grave and sudden provocation, loss of self-control, and a proportionate reaction. Test is objective (reasonable man) and subjective (did accused lose control?).

TOPIC: CONSPIRACY (Dr. Akeem Olajide Bello)
- Definition: Agreement of two or more to do an unlawful act or a lawful act by unlawful means (Majekodunmi v R). Offence is complete upon agreement.
- Types: Wheel conspiracy (Njovens v State), Chain conspiracy (State v Otu).
- Parties: Husband and wife cannot conspire alone under CC (Mawji v R), but this is abolished in Lagos CLLS 2011. A company can be a party to a conspiracy (R v ICR Haulage).
- Unlawful Purpose (S.518 CC): Must be a crime defined in a written law (Otegheri v. IGP).
- Impossibility: A person can be convicted of conspiracy to commit a crime which is impossible for them to commit alone (Majekodunmi v R).

TOPIC: DEFENCES TO CRIMINAL LIABILITY (Dr. Akeem Olajide Bello)
- Justification vs Excuse: Justification (act is outweighed by greater good, e.g., self-defence). Excuse (actor is not fully responsible, e.g., insanity).
- Public Duty / Superior Orders (S.32 CC): Defence unless the order is 'manifestly unlawful'.
- Self Defence (S.286 CC): Requires reasonable apprehension of death/grievous harm and use of necessary/proportional force.
- Minority/Immaturity (S.30 CC): Child under 7 is doli incapax. Child between 7-12 is presumed incapable unless capacity to know act was wrong is proven. Lagos CLLS 2011 sets age at 10.
- Insanity (S.28 CC): Based on M'Naghten rules. Requires a 'mental disease or natural mental infirmity' causing a defect of reason.
- Intoxication (S.29 CC): Involuntary intoxication is a full defence. Voluntary intoxication is only a defence if it induces a state of insanity or negates a specific intent required for the offence.
